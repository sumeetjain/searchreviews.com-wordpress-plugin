Get reviews from SearchReviews.com on your website.

== Description ==

Upon enabling this plugin, the SearchReviews.com widget Javascript is included in your theme. Additionally, a meta-box is added the New/Edit Post and New/Edit Page screens. This meta-box takes a list of keywords for which to search for reviews on SearchReviews.com.

If keywords are entered into the meta-box, the SearchReviews.com widget will appear at the top of your post/page. Clicking the widget will show a modal window with the reviews. If no keywords are entered, the widget will find its own keywords (from your page's H1 tag).

== Installation ==

1. Upload `searchreviews.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

One optional setting should be configured before use of the plugin. If you have a Publisher ID (assigned by SearchReviews.com), enter it in the widget settings screen. It's alright if you don't have a Publisher ID.

Posts and pages have a "SearchReviews.com Widget" meta-box. Just add keywords to this box to trigger the widget. Using the widget is optional - if you don't add keywords, the widget won't appear.
